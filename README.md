=============

Repository holds all code and unity handled files, and will work flawlessly after importing the latest asset package stored in our Box. 

Set up
----------

1. Use command line git, or a gui like Sourcetree to clone repository
2. Open unity and then File -> Open Project and select the folder Monster Marbles (I know thats not the name)
3. Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package and then select Box_Assets.x.x.x from your local Box directory

How to Push
------------

1. Ask Stu cause its my B Day and I don't want to write this section right now

Notes:

* Please be sure to load any newly created assets into a functional project (one which has both the git files and Box assets imported already)
* Make sure to use unity to import the new assets into the Box_Assets.  
* When finished adding assets, right click the Box _Asset folder in the project view and select export. 
* Export the package to the Box directory and save with an incremented version number.
